Welcome to the official repository for the lectures I delivered as part of the "Grind 75: FAANG Interview Preparation Workshop", hosted by iCodeGuru. This 7-day intensive workshop kicked off on March 16th, 2025, and was led by a passionate team of mentors and trainers (including myself), all driven by the goal of helping students prepare for technical interviews at top tech companies like FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google).

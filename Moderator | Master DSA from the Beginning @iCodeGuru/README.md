# ðŸŽ“ Master DSA from the Beginning - Moderator Role @ [@iCodeGuru](https://www.linkedin.com/company/icode-guru/posts/?feedView=all)

Welcome to the GitHub space where I share my journey as a moderator for the **"Master DSA from the Beginning"** sessions organized by [@iCodeGuru](https://www.linkedin.com/company/icode-guru/posts/?feedView=all).

## ðŸš€ Session Kick-Off

I had the honor to **inaugurate** this insightful DSA session, where I started by presenting an **introduction to [@iCodeGuru](https://www.linkedin.com/company/icode-guru/posts/?feedView=all)** using slides. The session was attended by approximately **30 students**.

We were fortunate to have **Sir Rizwan Ghaffar** join us. He addressed students' questions and provided valuable guidance regarding their **academic paths and career planning**, going beyond the scope of DSA.

Following that, **Sir Burhan** took over and gave a detailed overview of the **learning roadmap** and what students can expect from this DSA journey.
